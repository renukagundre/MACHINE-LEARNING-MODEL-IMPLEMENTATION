**This project implements a spam detection system using a Naive Bayes classifier. It loads a dataset of SMS messages, preprocesses the data by converting labels to binary, and splits it into training and testing sets. The text data is vectorized using CountVectorizer. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set, with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix displayed for performance assessment.**
